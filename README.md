As a Java Developer at BEHSA, a leading Telecom Vendor in Iran with 100+ million subscribers, I design and implement scalable and efficient solutions for large-scale projects. I have 6 years of experience in software development, with a bachelor's degree in computer software engineering from Islamic Azad University.

I excel at using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JUnit, API Design, and other technologies to develop microservices. I also have experience with DevOps tools like Docker, Git, CI/CD, and Linux, and databases like MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to adopt Agile methodologies and ensure alignment with business requirements. My achievements have been recognized with awards like "Best Employee of the Year" at BEHSA. 

I'm passionate about learning new skills and technologies, and I have completed several online courses and certifications, such as Java Programming Masterclass, Spring Boot Optimization, and Microservices. I'm also interested in crafting efficient solutions for problems and eager to contribute to tech and digital initiatives that make a positive impact on society. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, so feel free to reach out to me at ali.mirzajanzadeh@outlook.com.
